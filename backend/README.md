# Inventory Backend (CodeIgniter 4) - Starter

This is a minimal starter for a CodeIgniter 4 REST API for an Inventory Management System.
It contains example controllers, models, and SQL schema for quick setup.

**Notes**
- This is a simplified skeleton (not a full CodeIgniter app). For full CI4 app structure, run:
  `composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter .` and then copy controllers/models from here.
- Place the controller files in `app/Controllers/Api/` and models in `app/Models/`.
- Run the provided SQL to create tables.
